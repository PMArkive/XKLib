- Implementing a class for string obfuscation
- Implementing a secure way to send data over network (signature checks etc)
- Implementing a cross-platform detouring class
- A cross-platform VM for obfuscation (planning to make a gcc modification to support a custom CPU, or doing own scripting language)
It will be useful for whitebox cryptography
- A cross-platform memory scanner
- Making a class for using maybe something like libtins to send data over network
- a ELF/PE header parser ??? and aybe also classes to manual map ELF and PE binaries.
- cross-platform menu
- Implement a Bit class reader/writer for networking
